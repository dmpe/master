{\large\bf ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}
\end{center}

First and foremost, I would like to express my very great appreciation to my parents who allowed me to pursue my dreams, in many cases by sacrificing their own.
Hearing their countless advices and having a spiritual and financial support since my childhood, I hope that this graduate thesis will be rewarding to them the same way as it has been to me. 

Even more importantly, I would like to thank Prof.\ Dr.\ Freimut Bodendorf, M. Sc. Isabella Eigner and M. Sc. Alexander Piazza -- my research co-supervisors -- for their academic supervision, guidance, encouragements and critiques of this work.

Additionally, I am very grateful to Dr.\ John Morley of Manchester University in creating the \emph{Academic Phrasebank} -- an invaluable resource for all academicians.

Finally, I owe a debt of gratitude to the scholars at the University of Michigan in the USA who have developed a \LaTeX\ template that I have used, with adjustments, for my dissertation.
